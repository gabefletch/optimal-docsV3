## Legacy Docs Versions

### v1 (Discord)

The "v1" Docs version was a public Discord server ran directly by Gabe that lasted a little less than a year. It is still technically an existing server but only exists for archival purposes accessible only to members of [Optimal Team](../../optimal-team.md).&#x20;

### v2 (YNAW)

v2 of Docs was powered by [You Need A Wiki](https://youneedawiki.com) by developer Grant Kiely. It was originally chosen for its simple UI across desktop and mobile views.&#x20;

### v2 Framework&#x20;

YNAW is very unique from other site building tools because every page is a Google Drive document (either Docs, Sheets, or even Slides) that is shared to YNAW and displayed as a page in your wiki.&#x20;

By using the "Edit," "View in Drive," and "Add new," buttons, sites on YNAW take shape.&#x20;

### Featured Pages&#x20;

Before moving to GitBook (v3), Docs v2 featured the following pages:

* Welcome
* About Optimal
* Optimal for Android \
  \- Android App Sources\
  \- Android File Formats
* Optimal for iOS\
  \- iOS App Sources\
  \- iOS File Formats
* General FAQ
* Site Structure&#x20;
* History

All pages on v2 were much less detailed as it was not a priority at the time it was being worked on. Because v3 is much more relevant when it comes to relaunching Optimal on Readymag for v10, it has been worked on far more extensively.&#x20;

### Reasons for moving to v3 (GitBook)

Firstly, GitBook is the same framework that AltStore developer Riley Testut uses for their AltStore FAQ site. Secondly, Optimal is known to be a very dark site in terms of its UI and YNAW featured no dark mode support at the time that v2 was online, leading to a jarring transition between sites.&#x20;
