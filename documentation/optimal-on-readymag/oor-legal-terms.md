# âš– Optimal Legal Terms

<mark style="color:yellow;">Please note that the next major version of Optimal (v11) is under active development. Some portions of these terms only pertain to Optimal as it is in a full release state.</mark>

## Optimal General Disclaimer

{% hint style="success" %}
Last updated **Wednesday, July 26th, 2023.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Optimal, found at the shortlink [dub.sh/optimal](https://dub.sh/optimal), is a website developed by [Gabe Fletcher](https://dub.sh/gabe) for the intent of other users.&#x20;

All visual content on the site was produced by Gabe Fletcher, with the exception of copyrighted logos/icons, such as the YouTube logo, Twitch logo, and etc.&#x20;

The downloads provided on the Optimal site redirect users to a respective third party site that is not in affiliation with Optimal nor are they an Optimal URL. Documentation for what is considered an Optimal URL, also referred to as an Optimal Domain, can be found [here](oor-site-structure.md#subdomains-and-redirects-chart). Optimal was designed with the purpose of circumventing a user's need to manually browse ad-ridden sites for modified apps, and provides a direct download to such software using content delivery network parsing.&#x20;

To reiterate, absolutely none of the content that can be accessed via Optimal has been created by Optimal contributors or its developer Gabe Fletcher, as stipulated by each app descriptor on the Optimal site.&#x20;

## Optimal Responsibility Clause

{% hint style="success" %}
Last updated **Tuesday, January 24th, 2023.**
{% endhint %}

It is entirely the user's choice to engage in any activity that involves modifying pre-existing software, using third-party tools, or any other activity that is not explicitly condoned by software or hardware manufacturers, subject to that manufacturer's terms. Gabe Fletcher is not responsible for any action taken by device manufacturers to prevent further use of Optimal or any other activity that the manufacturer did not previously condone, nor is he responsible for any action that indirectly limit's the proper use of one's device. By using Optimal, the user is accepting the risks that are inherently present when taking part in modified software which, although rarely, can include but are not limited to: a device manufacturer refusing to provide service, a total software error that may prevent use of a device ("bricking"), or other restrictions placed on a user as a result of their previous actions.

## Optimal Privacy Policy&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Last updated **Tuesday, May 23rd, 2023.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Optimal collects no user data outside of the required data collected by our host, Webflow.

Optimal developers and contributors have no access to this aforementioned data. Optimal may occasionally request data to be voluntarily expressed by users in a form, but collects no data without their prior knowledge or consent, with the exception of browser cookies that allow Optimal sites to function. User data contained within cookies are not shared with any third party under any circumstances.

The Webflow privacy policy can be viewed at [https://webflow.com/legal/privacy](https://webflow.com/legal/privacy).

## Optimal Terms of Service

{% hint style="success" %}
Last updated **Tuesday, May 23rd, 2023.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Additional information was added to the [Optimal Domains list](https://optimaldocs.gitbook.io/optimal-docs-v3/documentation/optimal-on-readymag/oor-site-structure#subdomains-and-redirects-chart) on **Thursday, March 9th, 2023.**
{% endhint %}

By accessing an Optimal domain, as defined [here](oor-site-structure.md#subdomains-and-redirects-chart), you agree to refrain from copying, modifying, downloading, distributing, or otherwise infringing upon the ownership of the content on those domains in any manner seen as having done so by the owner of those domains, Gabe Fletcher.

Not doing so may result in termination of a user's access to Optimal domains via IP address blacklisting or any method seen suitable by the domain owner. \
\
Users are inherently subject to the terms of service, privacy policy, and any other legal guidelines established by the legal entities that own modified products accessible via Optimal. Some projects accessible via Optimal also have their own licenses that users are inherently subject to should they decide to use said projects.&#x20;

## Supervised Device Testing Disclaimer

{% hint style="success" %}
Added **Thursday, September 7th, 2023.**
{% endhint %}

Optimal's Lead Developer, Gabe Fletcher, and Head of iOS/iPadOS Quality Assurance, Ella Hawkins, are students of Shenandoah University in Winchester, Virginia. As such, this disclaimer regarding supervised devices provided by Shenandoah University has been added this date of Thursday, September 7th, 2023.

This disclaimer should also reasonably apply to any academic institution that allows for students to freely download executable software to devices running Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS, or Android.

Some devices found on the [**Documentation>Real-Hardware Testing**](real-hardware-testing.md) page are labeled as "Supervised" devices. This means that they have a supervision profile installed that cannot be removed or altered by the end user of the device. These devices are managed remotely by Shenandoah University and as such have their usage bound to Shenandoah University's IT Policy. The tools, testing, and installation performed by members of Optimal Team are compliant with Shenandoah University's IT Policy as stipulated by the heading, "Acceptable Use and Prohibited Conduct," Section "Personal Use":

> University IT equipment is primarily for education and business use to assist all users in the performance of their jobs and educational pursuits. Limited, occasional, or incidental use of university IT resources for personal, non-business/education purposes is understandable and acceptable, and all such use should be done in a manner that does not negatively affect the systems' use for their educational and/or business purposes. However, all users are expected to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and not abuse this privilege.\
> \
> [Shenandoah University IT Policy, "Acceptable Use and Prohibited Conduct," Section "Personal Use" ](https://sites.google.com/a/su.edu/itpolicy/home#h.p\_HOxgc2PBDi6a)

The use of Optimal cannot be said to, without a reasonable doubt, "negatively affect \[a] systems' use for educational and/or business purposes" as software curated via Optimal does not have the ability to alter the normal function or operation of devices as set forth by or intended by Shenandoah University, including SUnet, Hornet Hub, SU Canvas, and etc. This also reasonably applies to any similar academic institution that allows for students to freely download executable software such as [AltServer](https://faq.altstore.io/getting-started/how-to-install-altstore-macos) and/or [AltStore](https://altstore.io) on a device running Windows, macOS, iOS, iPadOS or Android, along with the download URLs curated by Optimal that contain the necessary .APK and .IPA files for installation via AltServer and AltStore, or the out-of-the-box sideloading capability provided by Android.

Optimal is also in compliance with the Shenandoah University IT Policy's extended Copyright Policy:

> All members of the Shenandoah University community must comply with federal copyright law (U.S. Code Title 17).Copyright infringement is defined as unauthorized possession or sharing of copyrighted materials, including but not limited to music, movies, computer software and games, videos or any other media which requires a license to possess. Sharing of copyrighted material without permission is a violation of the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92appb.html) (DMCA) and this policy. Both the entertainment and software industries actively monitor the Internet for possible copyright infringements with legal action becoming more common. The law requires the University to respond expeditiously when notified that a user is violating copyright law.\

> [Shenandoah University IT Policy, "Copyright Policy"](https://sites.google.com/a/su.edu/itpolicy/home#h.p\_pdzDds\_MD6lH)

Optimal does not host any of the downloads curated on its main site. Instead, Optimal provides direct links obtained through CDN parsing of other sites known to host the specified file(s). See the [**Optimal General Disclaimer**](oor-legal-terms.md#optimal-general-disclaimer) for more information. \
\
As a publicly accessible operating site hosted, created, and maintained in the United States, Optimal must be compliant with United States Copyright Law to exist, regardless of further stipulation set by Shenandoah University. Any changes made by Shenandoah University to their IT Policy will be respected by Optimal for use of supervised devices stipulated at [**Documentation>Real-Hardware Testing.**](real-hardware-testing.md)
