{% endhint %}

Optimal, hosted on Readymag, abbreviated to "OoR," is a website developed by [Gabe Fletcher](https://dub.sh/gabe) for the intent of other users.&#x20;

All visual content on the site was produced by Gabe Fletcher, with the exception of copyrighted logos/icons, such as the YouTube logo, Twitch logo, and etc.&#x20;

The downloads provided on the Optimal site redirect users to a respective third party site that is not in affiliation with Optimal nor are they an Optimal URL. Documentation for what is considered an Optimal URL can be found [here](oor-site-structure.md#subdomains-and-redirects-chart). Optimal was designed with the purpose of circumventing a user's need to manually browse ad-ridden sites for modified apps, and provides a direct download to such software using content delivery network parsing.&#x20;

To reiterate, absolutely none of the content that can be accessed via Optimal has been created by Optimal contributors or its developer Gabe Fletcher, as stipulated by each app descriptor on the Optimal site.&#x20;

## OoR Responsibility Clause

{% endhint %}

It is entirely the user's choice to engage in any activity that involves modifying pre-existing software, using third-party tools, or any other activity that is not explicitly condoned by software or hardware manufacturers, subject to that manufacturer's terms. Gabe Fletcher is not responsible for any action taken by device manufacturers to prevent further use of Optimal or any other activity that the manufacturer did not previously condone, nor is he responsible for any action that indirectly limit's the proper use of one's device. By using Optimal, the user is accepting the risks that are inherently present when taking part in modified software which,although rarely, can include but are not limited to: a device manufacturer refusing to provide service, a total software error that may prevent use of a device ("bricking"), or other restrictions placed on a user as a result of their previous actions.

Optimal developers and contributors have no access to this aforementioned data. Optimal may occasionally request data to be voluntarily expressed by users in a form, but collects no data without their prior knowledge or consent, with the exception of browser cookies.&#x20;
