## Optimal General Disclaimer

{% hint style="success" %}
Last updated **Wednesday, July 26th, 2023.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Optimal, found at the shortlink [dub.sh/optimal](https://dub.sh/optimal), is a website developed by [Gabe Fletcher](https://dub.sh/gabe) for the intent of other users.&#x20;

All visual content on the site was produced by Gabe Fletcher, with the exception of copyrighted logos/icons, such as the YouTube logo, Twitch logo, and etc.&#x20;

The downloads provided on the Optimal site redirect users to a respective third party site that is not in affiliation with Optimal nor are they an Optimal URL. Documentation for what is considered an Optimal URL, also referred to as an Optimal Domain, can be found [here](oor-site-structure.md#subdomains-and-redirects-chart). Optimal was designed with the purpose of circumventing a user's need to manually browse ad-ridden sites for modified apps, and provides a direct download to such software using content delivery network parsing.&#x20;

To reiterate, absolutely none of the content that can be accessed via Optimal has been created by Optimal contributors or its developer Gabe Fletcher, as stipulated by each app descriptor on the Optimal site.&#x20;

## Optimal Responsibility Clause

{% endhint %}

It is entirely the user's choice to engage in any activity that involves modifying pre-existing software, using third-party tools, or any other activity that is not explicitly condoned by software or hardware manufacturers, subject to that manufacturer's terms. Gabe Fletcher is not responsible for any action taken by device manufacturers to prevent further use of Optimal or any other activity that the manufacturer did not previously condone, nor is he responsible for any action that indirectly limit's the proper use of one's device. By using Optimal, the user is accepting the risks that are inherently present when taking part in modified software which, although rarely, can include but are not limited to: a device manufacturer refusing to provide service, a total software error that may prevent use of a device ("bricking"), or other restrictions placed on a user as a result of their previous actions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Additional information was added to the [Optimal Domains list](https://optimaldocs.gitbook.io/optimal-docs-v3/documentation/optimal-on-readymag/oor-site-structure#subdomains-and-redirects-chart) on **Thursday, March 9th, 2023.**
{% endhint %}

By accessing an Optimal domain, as defined [here](oor-site-structure.md#subdomains-and-redirects-chart), you agree to refrain from copying, modifying, downloading, distributing, or otherwise infringing upon the ownership of the content on those domains in any manner seen as having done so by the owner of those domains, Gabe Fletcher.

Not doing so may result in termination of a user's access to Optimal domains via IP address blacklisting or any method seen suitable by the domain owner. \
\
Users are inherently subject to the terms of service, privacy policy, and any other legal guidelines established by the legal entities that own modified products accessible via Optimal. Some projects accessible via Optimal also have their own licenses that users are inherently subject to should they decide to use said projects.&#x20;
