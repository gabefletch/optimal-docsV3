# üèÅ v11 Site Structure

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page focuses on pre-release content not yet available to the public, specifically Optimal v11 built on Framer.
{% endhint %}

## Designed on Figma, Hosted on Framer

Optimal versions 11+ interface prototypes are designed on Figma and are imported to and finalized on the Framer site engine. This allows for absolute control over the positioning of site elements, as both Figma and Framer are free-form, pixel-perfect content editors unlike layer-sequential editors such as Webflow.



This page will be updated as v11 development progresses on Framer.
