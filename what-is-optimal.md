# â„¹ What is Optimal?

## You Waste Money for Entertainment

If you're reading this on a mobile device, there is a 99.4% chance that it is running either Android or iOS.\* We love to use these devices everyday both as the tools they are and as the entertainment centers they have become. Countless subscription services exist for Android and iOS users to access the entertainment they want to see on a daily basis.&#x20;

Those services add up fast:

> $9.99 Spotify Premium + $11.99 YouTube Premium + $14.99 Twitch Prime = $36.97/month

## Optimal Completely Eliminates Subscriptions

Software modification has become more accessible than ever, and applying it towards the software that the masses use for hours on end is exactly what hobbyist developers have decided to do.&#x20;

Optimal is an easily accessible website designed to give its users access to specially modded versions of their most used apps with premium features enabled out of the box, eliminating the need to pay a subscription.&#x20;
