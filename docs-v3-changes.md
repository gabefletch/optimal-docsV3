{% endhint %}

### 4 October 2023

* Alters the Documentation section to separate previous current pages to the new [**Legacy v10**](documentation/optimal-on-readymag/) or [**Legacy v0-v9**](documentation/legacy/) page groups.
* Adds a new [**v11 Domain Chart**](documentation/v11-domain-chart.md) to be current for legal terms; changes legal term links to direct to this new page.
* Changes logo on the [**Welcome**](./) page to be "hero" length rather than "full" length for better image consistency across desktop and mobile.
* Adds header links: "Go to Optimal" (dub.sh/optimal); "Site Status" (dub.sh/optimal-status); "v11 Github" (dub.sh/optimal-github); "RVBA Github" (dub.sh/rvba)
* Changes sitewide accent color to better match logo colors

### 24 September 2023

* Updates image formatting and adds content about Optimal v11 to the [**Optimal History**](optimal-history.md) page.
* Updates the image formatting of the Docs wordmark on the [**Welcome** ](./)page.

### 15 September 2023

* Updated the URL to Gabe's portfolio site to go to the correct destination on the [**Optimal Team**](optimal-team.md) page.

### 5 September 2023

* Changed formatting of[ **Go to Optimal**](go-to-optimal.md) to provide more instructions on site access.

### 25 August 2023

* Created this changelog.
* Updated formatting on the [**Guides > Terminology**](guides/terminology.md) page to be more consistent.
* Updated some wording in the [**Guides > iOS FAQs**](guides/ios-faqs.md) page to reflect time passage.
* Changes ordering of the [**Documentation**](broken-reference) page group so that [**Documentation > Optimal Legal Terms**](documentation/optimal-on-readymag/oor-legal-terms.md) is first in the group.

Known Issues:

* Adding links to [**Documentation > Optimal Legal Terms**](documentation/optimal-on-readymag/oor-legal-terms.md) is currently broken, likely due to the length of text on that page. Attempting to add an in-line link will jump the typehead to the top of the page and enter the raw link there instead of the selected text. This issue originates from changes made by GitBook.
