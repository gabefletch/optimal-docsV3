### 25 August 2023

* Created this changelog.
* Updated formatting on the [**Guides > Terminology**](guides/terminology.md) page to be more consistent.
* Updated some wording in the [**Guides > iOS FAQs**](guides/ios-faqs.md) page to reflect time passage.
* Changes ordering of the [**Documentation**](broken-reference) page group so that [**Documentation > Optimal Legal Terms**](documentation/optimal-on-readymag/oor-legal-terms.md) is first in the group.

Known Issues:

* Adding links to [**Documentation > Optimal Legal Terms**](documentation/optimal-on-readymag/oor-legal-terms.md) is currently broken, likely due to the length of text on that page. Attempting to add an in-line link will jump the typehead to the top of the page and enter the raw link there instead of the selected text. This issue originates from changes made by GitBook.
