### Frequently Asked Questions - Optimal on iPhones

#### Where do I start with getting Optimal apps on my iPhone?

You'll want to head over to [**faq.altstore.io** ](https://faq.altstore.io)to view AltStore's official documentation. It will explain everything you need to know about installing non-App Store apps on your iPhone.&#x20;

**What is "AltStore"?**

AltStore is the method that Optimal utilizes to offer custom apps to iPhone users. Specifically, AltStore is an app developed by Riley Testut that is able to utilize an Apple ID to install up to 3 custom apps from outside of the App Store. (The AltStore app is included in this 3 app limit)

**Do I have to use AltStore?**

We strongly recommend the use of AltStore to install Optimal apps on your iPhone. Other methods exist but tend to be more complicated and less user friendly than AltStore. Optimal Team also has extensive experience with AltStore specifically and can't offer support for other methods such as SideLoadly, SideStore, etc.&#x20;

**Why can't I install more than 2 apps after getting AltStore?**

This is a limitation placed by Apple, not a mistake from Optimal or AltStore. Normal Apple IDs and Free Apple Developer accounts are limited to installing 3 custom apps on any device at a time, and AltStore is included in this limit, so only 2 custom apps can be installed after installing AltStore. The only ways to circumvent this limitation is to either have a Paid Apple Developer Account ($99 per year) or have a device running iOS 16.1 or below and using the MacDirtyCow exploit to remove the three app limitation. Devices running iOS 16.2 or above cannot be freed of the 3 app limit because Apple patched MacDirtyCow after this version.

**Why are there significantly less Optimal apps available for iPhone?**

[**Real-hardware testing**](../documentation/optimal-on-readymag/real-hardware-testing.md) just now became available to Optimal Team. This means that apps can be tested on a real iPhone rather than through development environments on Xcode and Simulator. The result is that Optimal Team has not had the opportunity to test for a comparitively large amount of custom apps like on Android. Apple's closed-source ecosystem also makes it considerably difficult to support with a project like Optimal that was originally only intended for Android.&#x20;
