**Step 1: Navigate to 'Install unknown apps'**

* Navigate to _Settings_. Search for and select _Install unknown apps_. Then, tap _Install unknown apps_ again.&#x20;

**Step 2: Allow Permission**

* Tap the source that you want to allow app installations from, such as Chrome. Then tap the switch next to allow "Allow form this source" to give permission.&#x20;

**Step 3: Try to Install the App**

* Your phone or tablet may prompt you with an option to allow Google to inspect installed apps for security. If enabled, this option may still prevent apps from installing.
* If this occurs, you can try going back to the app or file you'd like to install, and then try installing it again.&#x20;

Select **OnePlus** above and follow those steps. \
(Yes, it _will_ work. OnePlus and Pixel Android distributions are very similar.)

Go to your _Settings_ app and use the search feature to search for "Install unknown apps." \
Otherwise try visiting the support device of the company that makes your specific device or follow the steps for **OnePlus Device** above as OnePlus uses a relatively stock version of Android.&#x20;
