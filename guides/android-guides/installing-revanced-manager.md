{% endhint %}

### Pre-requisites

Unlike other mods on Optimal, ReVanced Manager is a **patching tool**, like [**xManager**](installing-xmanager.md). Unlike xManager, however, it does not install the modified version of your app for you. To remain compliant with the Terms of Service of the apps that it modifies, you have to provide the normal version of the app for ReVanced Manager to patch. This can be done simply by having the app installed.

### Disclaimer About Spotify Support on ReVanced Manager

While Spotify has patches available for it on ReVanced Manager it is highly recommended you use the [**xManager mod for Spotify**](installing-xmanager.md) because ReVanced does not give it Spotify Premium capabilities.

### Installing ReVanced Manager

#### Step 1

[**Tap here**](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases/download/v0.0.52/revanced-manager-v0.0.52.apk) to download the latest ReVanced Manager APK from GitHub&#x20;

#### Step 2

Open the APK file you downloaded in the last step and follow your device's prompts to install ReVanced Manager. If in doubt, tap "Install." If a Google Play Protect prompt appears, tap "Install Anyway."&#x20;
